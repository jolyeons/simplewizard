## Welcome

This is a trial run, so bear with me.  I'm using Jekyll themes for Github Pages, and going from there. Enjoy!

### Let's get going

Just going to try a few things and see how they show up.  This is a work in progress.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```
